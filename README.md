# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To start the project in VS Code:
- Open 2 separate terminals.
- Navigate to the backend subfolder in the first terminal
- install node modules with the command npm install
- run the command npm start or alternatively node server.js (keep in mind you need to rerun node server.js on every code change in the backend)
- Navigate to the frontend folder in the other terminal
- install node modules with the command npm install
- run the  command npm start
- When the terminal ask you "Would you like to run the app on another port instead?" press "Y"

The frontend wil automatically open in your default browser.
In case it doesn't, you can Ctrl + Click one of the two links presented in the terminal.
